# tarotReader

This Tarot app makes hits to a web API that serves up tarot card images, names, and descriptions.

Both the app and the API are built in Swift, using <a href = "https://www.swiftengine.io/">SwiftEngine</a>.

SwiftEngine offers both a framework for building sites with Swift, and free hosting. This makes it ideal for quickly producing APIs for small iOS projects, such as this one.
